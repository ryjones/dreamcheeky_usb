dreamcheeky_usb
===============
This is a combination of an easyhid project and a dcusb project to allow the control of a DreamCheeky USB LED
Message Board [seen here](https://www.last-outpost.com/~malakai/dcled/) on a current Mac in python.  There's a 
`weather.py` example that takes an openweathermap.org API key and a ZIP code as environment variables and displays 
both the temperature and current time on the USB message board.
